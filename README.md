![Project Preview](./assets/project-preview.png)

## 📄 About

This project is a modern, responsive **Enrollment Form** designed for a fictional kindergarten school named "Estrelas do Amanhã".

The main goal of this application is to provide a user-friendly interface for parents to register their children, demonstrating advanced HTML5 and CSS3 skills, particularly in form styling and layout construction.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

This project was built using pure web technologies without external frameworks, ensuring high performance and semantic structure:

* **HTML5**: Semantic markup for accessibility and structure.
* **CSS3**:
    * **CSS Variables**: For consistent theming (colors, fonts).
    * **Flexbox**: For responsive layouts and alignment.
    * **Modular CSS**: Styles organized into separate files (`inputs.css`, `buttons.css`, etc.) for better maintainability.
* **Google Fonts**: Typography using the *Poppins* font family.

## 🎨 Features

* **Responsive Layout**: A two-column layout that adapts to smaller screens (Main form area + Promotional aside).
* **Custom Form Controls**:
    * Styled **Radio Buttons** with icons (Sports selection & Study shift).
    * Custom **Checkbox** for terms and conditions.
    * Custom **File Dropzone** for birth certificate upload.
* **Fieldsets & Legends**: Organized sections for Child Info, Residential Address, Guardian Info, and Enrollment Options.
* **Visual Feedback**: Styles for active, disabled, and error states (e.g., email validation).
